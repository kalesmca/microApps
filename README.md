# micorApps
npm install => we need to do all remote and host applications
npm run build => need to do all remote and host application(host optional)
npm start => all application finally host application.

Main Container is Host App
EmployeeFormsAPP and EmployeeListApp both remotes

Idea:
EmployeeFormsAPP => this application is for registration form
EmployeeListApp => this application is for listed what we saved from EmployeesApp.
ManContainerAPP => here we hosted both remotes

State management :
I usese Redux in EmployeeFormsApp and I shared both remote and maincontainer also.
